### WebSocket Integration

The ETRMS frontend uses WebSocket connections for real-time data updates across various pages.

#### WebSocket Service

The system implements a custom WebSocket service that handles:

- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Ping/pong mechanism to keep the connection alive
- Error handling
- Connection status tracking
- Message parsing

This service is exposed through a custom `useWebSocket` hook in the React frontend, making it easy to connect components to real-time data sources.

#### React Integration

The WebSocket integration is implemented in the following components:

1. **Accounts Page**: Displays real-time account information including:
   - Balance updates
   - Margin levels
   - Funding payments

2. **RiskManagement Page**: Displays real-time risk metrics and alerts including:
   - Risk metrics updates (equity, exposure, drawdown, P&L)
   - Circuit breaker alerts
   - Position-specific risk data
   - Exchange-specific metrics
   
   The RiskManagement page displays a live indicator when connected to WebSockets and shows timestamp for the last data update. It gracefully falls back to polling the API if WebSockets are unavailable.

3. **WebSocketStatus Component**: A reusable component that:
   - Displays the current connection status
   - Shows error messages
   - Provides a reconnect button
   - Uses different colors and icons to indicate status

#### Available Channels

The WebSocket service provides the following channels:

- `POSITIONS`: Real-time updates on position changes
- `ACCOUNTS`: Real-time updates on account balances and margin
- `RISK_METRICS`: Real-time updates on risk metrics and circuit breakers
- `ALERTS`: Notifications for triggered circuit breakers and risk limit violations

Each channel can be subscribed to independently, allowing components to receive only the data they need.

#### API Endpoints

The backend provides the following WebSocket endpoints:

- `/api/v1/ws/positions`: WebSocket endpoint for position updates
- `/api/v1/ws/accounts`: WebSocket endpoint for account updates
- `/api/v1/ws/risk-metrics`: WebSocket endpoint for risk metrics updates
- `/api/v1/ws/alerts`: WebSocket endpoint for real-time alerts

These endpoints are secured and require authentication to connect.

### Usage Examples

#### Risk Monitoring

The RiskManagement page provides comprehensive real-time risk monitoring capabilities:

```jsx
// In RiskManagement.js
const { 
  data: riskMetricsData, 
  status: riskMetricsStatus, 
  isConnected: isRiskMetricsConnected 
} = useWebSocket(Channels.RISK_METRICS);

const { 
  data: alertsData, 
  status: alertsStatus, 
  isConnected: isAlertsConnected 
} = useWebSocket(Channels.ALERTS);

// Update risk metrics when received from WebSocket
useEffect(() => {
  if (riskMetricsData) {
    setLastUpdated(new Date());
    
    // Process the data structure from WebSocket
    let metricsData;
    if (riskMetricsData.risk_metrics) {
      metricsData = riskMetricsData.risk_metrics;
    } else if (riskMetricsData.data && riskMetricsData.data.risk_metrics) {
      metricsData = riskMetricsData.data.risk_metrics;
    } else if (riskMetricsData.data) {
      metricsData = riskMetricsData.data;
    } else {
      metricsData = riskMetricsData;
    }
    
    // Update risk metrics state
    setRiskMetrics(metricsData);
    
    // Handle any circuit breaker updates included in the data
    if (breakersData) {
      setCircuitBreakers(breakersData);
    }
  }
}, [riskMetricsData]);

// Handle circuit breaker alerts
useEffect(() => {
  if (alertsData && alertsData.type === 'circuit_breaker_triggered') {
    // Handle the alert
    const alert = alertsData.data || alertsData;
    
    // Update the UI to reflect the triggered condition
    // ...
  }
}, [alertsData]);
```

The RiskManagement page displays:
- Risk overview with equity, position value, unrealized P&L, and active positions
- Drawdown metrics with period-based risk indicators
