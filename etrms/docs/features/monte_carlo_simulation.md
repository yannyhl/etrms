# Monte Carlo Simulation

## Overview

Monte Carlo Simulation is an advanced analysis technique in the ETRMS backtesting module that provides insights into the robustness and risk profile of trading strategies. By randomizing the order of historical trades and running multiple simulations, it helps traders understand the probability distribution of possible outcomes rather than relying on a single historical sequence.

## Purpose

The primary purposes of Monte Carlo simulation in trading strategy evaluation are:

1. **Understand Outcome Variability**: See how different trade sequences could affect final performance
2. **Assess Strategy Robustness**: A truly robust strategy should perform well across various randomized sequences
3. **Calculate Risk Metrics**: Derive statistical measures like Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)
4. **Stress Test Strategies**: Examine how strategies might perform under different market conditions
5. **Evaluate Path Dependency**: Determine if strategy success depends on specific trade ordering

## How Monte Carlo Simulation Works

The ETRMS Monte Carlo Simulator follows these steps:

1. **Input Processing**: Takes a set of historical trades from a previously run backtest
2. **Randomization**: Shuffles the order of trades while preserving their profit/loss characteristics
3. **Equity Curve Generation**: For each simulation, calculates a new equity curve based on the randomized trade sequence
4. **Metric Calculation**: Computes performance metrics for each simulation
5. **Statistical Analysis**: Aggregates results across all simulations to create probability distributions
6. **Risk Assessment**: Calculates risk metrics based on the distribution of outcomes

## Using Monte Carlo Simulation

### Prerequisites

Before running a Monte Carlo simulation, you need:
- A completed backtest with trade history
- The backtest task ID

### Running a Simulation

1. Navigate to a completed backtest in the ETRMS interface
2. Click on the "Monte Carlo Analysis" tab
3. Configure the simulation parameters:
   - **Number of Simulations**: Higher values (e.g., 1000) provide more statistically significant results
   - **Random Seed**: Optional value to ensure reproducibility of results
4. Click "Run Simulation" to start the analysis

### Simulation Parameters

- **Number of Simulations**: Controls how many randomized trade sequences to generate (typically 100-10,000)
- **Random Seed**: Optional parameter that ensures the same random sequences are generated each time
- **Initial Balance**: The starting account balance for each simulation (defaults to the backtest's initial balance)

## Interpreting Results

The Monte Carlo simulation results are presented in several sections:

### Summary Statistics

This section provides aggregate statistics across all simulations:

- **Average Final Balance**: The mean ending account value across all simulations
- **Median Final Balance**: The middle value of ending account values (less affected by outliers)
- **Best Case Balance**: The highest ending balance achieved
- **Worst Case Balance**: The lowest ending balance achieved
- **Standard Deviation**: Measures the dispersion of final balances
- **Profit Probability**: Percentage of simulations that ended with a profit
- **Loss Probability**: Percentage of simulations that ended with a loss

### Risk Metrics

Critical for risk assessment:

- **Value at Risk (VaR)**: The maximum expected loss at a given confidence level (e.g., 95% VaR)
- **Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)**: Also known as Expected Shortfall, the average loss in the worst-case scenarios
- **Maximum Drawdown Range**: The range of maximum drawdowns observed across all simulations

### Visualization Components

The Monte Carlo simulation provides several visual aids:

#### Equity Curves Chart

Shows multiple equity curves representing different simulations, including:
- Median curve highlighted
- Percentile bands (e.g., 25th-75th percentile range)
- Original backtest curve for comparison

#### Final Balance Distribution

A histogram showing the distribution of final account balances across all simulations, indicating:
- Probability density
- Key statistics (mean, median, mode)
- VaR cutoff points

#### Drawdown Distribution

A histogram showing the distribution of maximum drawdowns across all simulations, helping you understand:
- Worst-case drawdown scenarios
- Probability of exceeding specific drawdown thresholds

#### Win/Loss Distribution

Charts showing the distribution of winning and losing streaks across simulations.

## Common Use Cases

### Risk Assessment

Use Monte Carlo simulation to:
- Determine the appropriate position sizing based on worst-case scenarios
- Calculate the risk of ruin (probability of losing a critical portion of your capital)
- Set realistic stop-loss levels based on expected drawdowns

### Strategy Comparison

Compare strategies by:
- Running identical Monte Carlo simulations on multiple strategies
- Comparing robustness based on result distributions rather than single backtest results
- Evaluating not just average performance but consistency across simulations

### Confidence Interval Determination

Use percentile bands to:
- Establish realistic performance expectations
- Set upper and lower bounds for anticipated results
- Communicate probability-based projections to stakeholders

## Best Practices

1. **Run Sufficient Simulations**: More simulations (1,000+) provide more reliable statistical distributions
2. **Consider Trade Correlation**: Remember that Monte Carlo simulation assumes trade independence, which may not always be valid
3. **Compare to Original Backtest**: Note how the original backtest compares to the distribution of simulated outcomes
4. **Focus on Risk Metrics**: Pay special attention to downside risk measures rather than just upside potential
5. **Use for Relative Comparison**: Monte Carlo is more useful for comparing strategies than for absolute performance prediction

## Limitations

Keep in mind these limitations of Monte Carlo simulation:

1. **Assumes Trade Independence**: Traditional Monte Carlo assumes trades are independent events, which may not reflect market reality
2. **Based on Historical Data**: All projections are based on what happened in the past, which may not predict future conditions
3. **Simplifies Market Conditions**: Doesn't account for changing market regimes unless specifically designed to
4. **Computationally Intensive**: Running large numbers of simulations may take significant processing time
