# Walk-Forward Analysis

## Overview

Walk-Forward Analysis is an advanced backtesting technique designed to validate the robustness of trading strategies and their parameters. It helps address the common problem of curve fitting (overfitting) in strategy development by testing optimized parameters on out-of-sample data, providing a more realistic expectation of future performance.

## How Walk-Forward Analysis Works

The Walk-Forward Analysis process follows these steps:

1. **Divide Data**: The historical data is divided into a series of overlapping windows.
2. **Parameter Optimization**: For each window, a portion of the data (in-sample data) is used to optimize strategy parameters.
3. **Out-of-Sample Testing**: The optimized parameters are then tested on the remaining portion of the window (out-of-sample data) without further optimization.
4. **Performance Evaluation**: Results from all out-of-sample periods are combined to evaluate the strategy's performance.

This approach mimics how a strategy would be periodically recalibrated in a real trading environment.

## Using Walk-Forward Analysis in ETRMS

### Configuration

1. **Navigate** to the Backtesting page and select the "Walk-Forward Analysis" tab.
2. **Select a Strategy**: Choose the trading strategy you want to analyze.
3. **Choose Symbols**: Specify the trading symbols to include in the analysis.
4. **Set Date Range**: Define the start and end dates for the entire analysis period.
5. **Configure Window Settings**:
   - **Window Size (days)**: The total number of days in each analysis window.
   - **Step Size (days)**: How many days to advance for each new window. Smaller step sizes create more overlapping windows.
   - **In-Sample Percentage**: The percentage of each window to use for parameter optimization (e.g., 0.7 for 70%).
6. **Parameter Grid**: Enable parameters to optimize and specify values to test for each parameter.
7. **General Backtest Settings**: Configure standard backtest settings such as initial balance, fees, slippage, and risk per trade.

### Running the Analysis

After configuring all settings, click "Run Walk-Forward Analysis" to start the process. The system will:

1. Generate all the analysis windows based on your settings.
2. For each window, optimize parameters on the in-sample portion.
3. Test the optimized parameters on the out-of-sample portion.
4. Combine results from all out-of-sample tests.
5. Create visualizations of the performance and parameter evolution.

This process may take some time depending on the complexity of the strategy, the number of windows, and the parameter grid size.

## Interpreting Results

The Walk-Forward Analysis results are presented in several sections:

### Analysis Overview

This section provides a summary of the analysis configuration and the combined performance metrics from all out-of-sample periods, giving you an overview of how your strategy would have performed with periodic recalibration.

### Window Performance Comparison

This chart displays the performance of each window, showing both in-sample (optimization) and out-of-sample (testing) results. This helps you identify:

- **Consistency**: Is the strategy consistently profitable across different time periods?
- **In-Sample vs. Out-of-Sample Gap**: A large gap between in-sample and out-of-sample performance may indicate overfitting.
- **Performance Trends**: Does performance improve, degrade, or remain stable over time?

### Parameter Evolution

This chart shows how the optimized parameters change across windows. This helps you understand:

- **Parameter Stability**: Stable parameters across windows indicate a more robust strategy.
- **Parameter Sensitivity**: Large fluctuations may indicate parameter sensitivity to market conditions.
- **Trend Patterns**: Certain parameters may show trends that correlate with market regimes.

### Window Details

This table provides detailed information for each window, including:

- Date ranges for each window
- Performance metrics for both in-sample and out-of-sample periods
- Optimized parameter values for each window

## Interpreting Walk-Forward Effectiveness

A successful walk-forward analysis typically shows:

1. **Consistent Out-of-Sample Performance**: Results should be positive and relatively stable across windows.
2. **Reasonable Parameter Stability**: Parameters shouldn't change dramatically from window to window.
3. **Small In-Sample/Out-of-Sample Gap**: The performance difference between optimization and testing periods should be minimal.
4. **Positive Combined Metrics**: The overall combined performance metrics should be positive and aligned with your trading goals.

## Best Practices

1. **Use Sufficient Data**: Ensure you have enough historical data to create meaningful windows.
2. **Set Appropriate Window Sizes**: Windows should be large enough to contain statistically significant number of trades.
3. **Limit Parameter Combinations**: Keep the parameter grid focused to avoid data mining bias.
4. **Test Multiple In-Sample Percentages**: Try different splits between optimization and testing periods (e.g., 60/40, 70/30, 80/20).
5. **Compare with Standard Backtests**: Use walk-forward results alongside regular backtest results for a more complete picture.
