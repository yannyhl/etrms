## Getting Started

The following tasks should be prioritized to make quick progress:

1. Complete the database models and repositories
2. Implement the Binance Futures client
3. Implement the core risk monitoring functionality
4. Implement the basic account and position API endpoints

These components will provide the foundation for a minimally functional system that can be expanded with additional features.

## Resources Required

- **Backend Developer**: Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, asyncio
- **DevOps Engineer**: Docker, CI/CD, infrastructure
- **Testing Specialist**: pytest, testing strategies
- **Frontend Developer**: React, TypeScript (for any frontend adjustments)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Exchange API Changes**: Monitor for changes to exchange APIs and adapt quickly
- **Performance Issues**: Profile early and often to identify bottlenecks
- **Security Concerns**: Regular security audits and following best practices
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to the implementation plan and prioritize core functionality

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. A user can connect to at least one exchange (Binance)
2. The system can monitor positions and calculate risk metrics
3. Circuit breakers can be configured and triggered
4. The frontend displays real-time data from the backend
5. Core functionality is covered by automated tests

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to completing the ETRMS system. By following this plan and focusing on incremental delivery of functionality, we can efficiently build a robust risk management system for cryptocurrency trading.

The estimated total effort is approximately 12-18 weeks, depending on resource availability and any unforeseen challenges. Regular reviews of progress against this plan will help ensure the project stays on track.
